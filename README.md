# CoverMe

This project is an automatic cover letter writer.
It scrapes the job posting page for key words.
Based on those keywords. The appropriate sections of the cover letter will be placed together.

The implementation here uses JSON:

the key will be searched for.
if found the value is added to the cover letter.

This is extensible for other formats though.

I'm not sure I can advise using this put enjoy
